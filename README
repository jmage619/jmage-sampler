JMAGE Sampler
=============

JMAGE Sampler is a Linux based sampler. It can be run as stand alone JACK
application or as an LV2 Plugin. The goal of JMAGE Sampler is to be able to
create many zoned, multi layered patches quickly from scratch, with all the
controls up front and tweakable in real time.

What JMAGE Sampler is NOT is a disk streaming sampler. All samples are loaded in
memory. JMAGE Sampler can read SFZ files, but only parses the fields it
currently supports. There are NO guarantees that an arbitrary SFZ file will not
crash the sampler, especially if the patch is intended for disk streaming.

Patches can be saved in SFZ or JMZ format, an extension to SFZ that also stores
JMAGE Sampler specific fields. JMZ should be preferred for normal usage.

Building / Installing
---------------------
JMAGE Sampler has the following dependencies:

- Jack Audio Connection Kit:
  http://jackaudio.org/

- libsndfile:
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

- libsamplerate:
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/

- LV2:
  http://lv2plug.in/

- Qt 5:
  http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/

Ensure the libraries and headers for the above are installed

The build also requres the CMake system to be installed:
https://cmake.org/

To compile, from the jmage-sampler directory, run the commands:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

Alternatively if your system requires a suffix for the libdir, e.g.
/usr/local/lib64:

cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 ../

To install, as the root user, run:
make install

Support
-------
JMAGE Sampler was mostly conceived as a selfish project. The developers created
this for their own music production purposes. There are no guarantees feature
requests or bug fixes will be acknowledged or implemented in any kind of timely
fasion.

Usage
-----
Samples are loaded into a grid where all controls are visible. Click the "+"
button to load an audio file. Supports: *.wav, *.aiff, *.flac, possibly others
but those were the only types currently tested.

All controls are directly editable. Depending on the field type, clicking may
pop up a submenu for selection. Most numeric fields can be modded by
click-dragging the box directly.

Middle clicking fields that have a default position cause them to reset. Mouse
wheel is supported for most numeric fields.
